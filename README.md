# Week 5 Wed Homework

## Directions

Implement the function **hasCycle** in **Homework2.cpp**. Do not change the name of the cpp file. 

```C++
bool hasCycle(Node* head)
```
Takes the head of list as parameter and determines if there is a cycle in the list. If the cycle is detected it should return true otherwise return false.

DO NOT change any other part of the program.

Submit your output to canvas.
